# Minesweeper Experiment

This is a small project I completed a few months ago, in which I added most of the features (including some quality of life ones!) that you would expect to find in a minesweeper game in order to practise basic programming and design techniques.

I even devised an algorithm based off of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) which I believe can create harder minefields, by reducing mine clustering and thus making mines harder to eliminate on average.
